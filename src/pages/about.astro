		<span class="font-bold">A note from the creator:</span> This project started
		in my living room. My wife and I were trying to figure out estimated monthly
		payments for our first home purchase, and I found myself frustrated with
		clunky calculators full of ads and upsells. So I built something simple—just
		for us. But as we kept planning our life together—car loans, budgeting, paying
		down debt—I kept adding more tools. And I realized: if we needed this, others
		probably do too. So here we are. What began as a personal side project has
		become something we're proud to share with you.
	</p>

<!-- 	<p>
		<span class="font-bold">Here's the reality:</span> We both work full-time
		jobs. This is a labor of love that I maintain in the evenings and weekends.
		Keeping the servers running and the site ad-free costs real money, but we
		believe everyone deserves access to honest, straightforward financial tools—no
		hidden agendas, no data harvesting, no premium tiers. If these calculators
		have helped you, we'd be grateful for your support. Every contribution—whether
		it's a one-time donation or a small monthly amount—helps us keep the lights
		on and the site free for everyone.

		<span class="font-bold">Thank you for being here!</span> I hope you find these tools helpful on your own journey.
